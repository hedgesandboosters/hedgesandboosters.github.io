<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:7%;"> <em>Introduction:</em> Hedges and boosters are terms respectively used to decrease and increase the strength of statements.<br>
<em>Objectives:</em> We present an analysis of the use of hedges and boosters in the CHI proceedings between 2010 and 2018 to better understand how CHI authors report empirical findings.<br>
<em>Methods:</em> We only considered papers reporting a user study and focused our analysis on the sentences in the abstract that describe empirical results. We used a program to detect boosters and hedges and manually adjusted their classifications.<br>
<em>Results:</em> We found that CHI studies reporting inferential statistics are more likely to boost than they hedge.<br>
<em>Conclusion:</em> Understanding the use of hedging and boosting will assist HCI authors in properly reporting their research. Our results establish a baseline of the current use of these terms at CHI.<br>
<em>Reproducibility:</em> All data and scripts are available on <a href="https://osf.io/kefmr/?view_only=907b8e550ee84fcc927a36cc1d2adbcf">osf.io</a></p>

    <p class="c1"><span>1/ </span><span>A </span><span class="c4">study report</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;is a paper that reports research involving human participants. The report must be on an original study: surveys, discussions, and re-analyses of previous studies do not qualify.</span></p>
    <ul class="c6 lst-kix_hc0vmf26eh4o-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c2 li-bullet-0"><span>If the paper is a study report, write &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c15">Y</span><span class="c7">&rdquo; in the &quot;Study&quot; column</span></li>

    </ul>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>2/ An </span><span class="c4">inferential study report</span><span>&nbsp;is a study paper that reports study results using </span><span>measures of statistical uncertainty such as test statistics, p-values, interval estimates (confidence intervals, credible intervals, standard errors, but </span><span class="c0">not</span><span>&nbsp;standard deviations), Bayesian posteriors, or Bayes factors. All of these can be reported either numerically or graphically. &nbsp;It is not necessary that the paper </span><span class="c0">only</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;report inferential statistics.</span></p>
    <ul class="c6 lst-kix_bpmyrl3dj3go-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c2 li-bullet-0"><span>If a paper is an inferential report, write &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c15">inferential</span><span class="c7">&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Type&quot; column.</span></li>

    <p class="c1"><span>3/ An </span><span class="c4">abstract</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;is the first section of a paper and is titled &ldquo;Abstract&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7 c22"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>4/ A </span><span class="c4">result</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">description</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>is a sentence that describes or summarizes the </span><span>results</span><span>&nbsp;of a study, explains them, or discusses their</span><span>&nbsp;implications</span><span>. As a general rule, it is a sentence that may have been different had the results been different. Both sentences in the following excerpt are result-relevant: </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;We found that touch interaction is slower but more precise than tangible interaction. This suggests that designers and developers should consider this tradeoff when designing applications&rdquo;</span><span>. Counterexamples include generic statements that carry no information about the results or their implications (e.g., </span><span class="c0">&quot;We then discuss our results&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">&quot;We conclude with implications for design&quot;</span><span>)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>and future work statements that do not clearly derive from the results (e.g., </span><span class="c0">&quot;In future work, we will investigate alternative designs&quot;</span><span>)</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;Conversely, future work statements that are clearly informed by the results qualify, e.g., </span><span class="c0">&quot;Given this result, more complex designs should be investigated in the future&quot;. </span><span>However, we exclude the description of further research steps that were carried out based on the results of a study and reported in the same paper, e.g., </span><span class="c0">&quot;This finding led us to design a second experiment where we tested the effect of task. We recruited 20 other participants [...]&quot;</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>5/ A </span><span class="c4">modal term</span><span>&nbsp;is a term that is used either to tone down a statement, or to increase its strength. Examples are the word </span><span class="c0">&quot;may&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;in </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;The drug </span><span class="c4 c0">may</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have an effect on sleep&rdquo; </span><span>or the word </span><span class="c0">&quot;definitely&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;in </span><span class="c0">&quot;The drug </span><span class="c4 c0">definitely</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has an effect on sleep&quot;.</span><span>&nbsp;However, the word </span><span class="c0">&quot;definitely&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is not considered a modal term in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&quot;One participant said she would </span><span class="c4 c0">definitely</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;use the tool in the future&quot;</span><span>, because changing it would alter the meaning of the statement. As a general rule,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>if a term can be removed or replaced by another term in a way that alters the </span><span class="c0">subjective strength</span><span>&nbsp;of the statement made by the authors without altering its </span><span class="c0">objective meaning</span><span>, then it is a modal term. As another example, in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&quot;We found a </span><span class="c4 c0">strong</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;correlation&quot;</span><span>, the term </span><span class="c0">&quot;strong&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;partly reflects a subjective judgment by the authors, who could have easily used a term like </span><span class="c0">&quot;substantial&quot;</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;instead. Therefore, it is a modal term. We have already identified a number of potential modal terms in the sentences you will code, by searching within a dictionary of common modal terms. All matches will be highlighted in gray. However, there will be a good number of false positives, so we will ask you to indicate whether each of those terms highlighted in gray is indeed a modal term, and if so, to indicate its type. Modal terms come in two types: hedges and boosters, explained below. We will ask you to only mark terms that are evident hedges or evident boosters --- if you cannot decide between hedge and booster, leave the term in gray.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>6/ A </span><span class="c4">hedge</span><span>&nbsp;is a term that is used to tone down a statement, for example by making it appear more fuzzy or more uncertain. Examples of hedges include </span><span class="c0">&quot;possibly&quot;</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">&quot;approximately&quot;</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">&quot;sometimes&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">&quot;speculate&quot;</span><span>. For example, the sentence </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;The drug </span><span class="c4 c0">may </span><span class="c0">have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;an effect on sleep&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;is weaker than the simpler sentence </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;The drug </span><span class="c0">has</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;an effect on sleep&rdquo;</span><span>, so </span><span class="c0">&quot;may&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is a hedge in the first sentence. Other examples are </span><span class="c0">&quot;The technique was </span><span class="c4 c0">roughly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;twice as fast&quot; </span><span>(which increases fuzziness), or </span><span class="c0">&quot;The effect is </span><span class="c4 c0">somehow</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;large&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;(which decreases strength). Hedges are not necessarily modifiers. For example, in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&quot;Our results </span><span class="c4 c0">suggest</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that the drug has an effect&quot;</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">&quot;suggest&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is a hedge because a stronger verb (like </span><span class="c0">&quot;show&quot;</span><span>) could have been easily used instead. As a third example, the word </span><span class="c0">&quot;speculate&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;acts as a hedge in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&quot;We </span><span class="c4 c0">speculate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that our findings are due to a difference in performance&quot;</span><span>. An example of a clear false positive is the term &quot;</span><span class="c0">may&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;in the following sentence: </span><span class="c0">&quot;We conducted our study in </span><span class="c4 c0">May</span><span class="c0">&quot;</span><span>. </span><span>Similarly, the word </span><span class="c0">&quot;speculate&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is not a hedge in the sentence: </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our subjects often had to </span><span class="c4 c0">speculate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;about the actual goal of the task&quot;</span><span>, because its role is not to reduce the force of the author&#39;s statement</span><span class="c7">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>7/ A </span><span class="c4">booster</span><span>&nbsp;is a term that is used to increase the strength of a statement, for example by making it appear sharper or more certain. It has the opposite effect of a hedge. Examples of boosters include </span><span class="c0">&quot;definitely&quot;</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">&quot;strongly&quot;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;exactly&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">&quot;prove&quot;</span><span>. For example, the statement </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;The drug has a </span><span class="c4 c0">clear</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;effect on sleep&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;appears stronger than </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;The drug has an effect on sleep&rdquo;</span><span>, so </span><span class="c0">&quot;</span><span class="c0">clear</span><span class="c0">&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;acts as a booster in the first sentence. Other examples are </span><span class="c0">&quot;The technique was </span><span class="c4 c0">exactly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;twice as fast&quot; </span><span>(which increases sharpness), or </span><span class="c0">&quot;The effect is </span><span class="c0 c4">extremely</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;large&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;(which increases strength). Like hedges, boosters are not necessarily modifiers. &nbsp;For example, in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&quot;Our results </span><span class="c4 c0">show</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that the drug has an effect&quot;</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">&quot;show&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is a booster because a weaker verb (like </span><span class="c0">&quot;suggest&quot;</span><span>) could have been easily used instead. &nbsp;As a third example, the word </span><span class="c0">&quot;demonstrated&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is a booster in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&quot;We </span><span class="c4 c0">demonstrated</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that our findings are due to a difference in performance&quot;</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;However, the word </span><span class="c0">&quot;demonstrated&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is not a booster in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our subjects </span><span class="c4 c0">demonstrated</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their expertise&quot;, </span><span>because its role is not to increase the force of the author&#39;s statement</span><span class="c7">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>8/ </span><span>You will see cases where it is difficult to decide whether a term is a modal term, and whether a modal term is a hedge or a booster. For example, in the sentence </span><span class="c0">&quot;We </span><span class="c4 c0">found</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that 72% of the participants were faster with A than B&quot;</span><span>, you may find that the term </span><span class="c0">&quot;found&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is not a clear hedge or a clear booster. In that case, leave the term in gray. Again, focus on terms that strike you as clear hedges or boosters. If you cannot decide whether a term is a hedge or a booster or it takes you too long to decide, leave it in gray. Keep in mind that there may be a good number of false positives among the terms highlighted in gray.<br></span></p>
