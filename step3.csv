2016,"p1312-friedberg","Abstract","In contrast to traditional designers, green designers appear to: (1) Bias decisions (2) Design from a deep, personal ethos; (3) Accept ‘not knowing’ as a part of the design process; (4) Rely on alternative ways of knowing, and; (5) Shift roles as needed throughout the design process."
2016,"p1312-friedberg","Abstract","While a superficial treatment of these differences might seem to disenfranchise green designers, we show that an analysis of green design as a discursive practice highlights how, through engagement with others, green design can enhance pro-environmental dialog and enact meaningful change."

2012,"p1287","Abstract","They also differed in shape geometry as measured by, for example, aperture of closed gestures, corner shape distance and intersecting points deviation; (2) Pen drawn gestures and finger drawn gestures were similar in several measures including articulation time, indicative angle difference, axial symmetry and proportional shape distance; (3) There were interaction effects between gesture implement (finger vs. pen) and target gesture size and gesture complexity."
2012,"p1287","Abstract","Our findings show that half of the features we tested were performed well enough by the finger."
2012,"p1287","Abstract","This finding suggests that “finger friendly” systems should exploit these features when designing finger interfaces and avoid using the other features in which the finger does not perform as well as the pen."

2014,"p2451","Abstract","Furthermore, we found that while each document is created as part of a quasi-sequential order, this characteristic does not make the document, as a single entity, into a stable object."
2014,"p2451","Abstract","Instead, we found that the documents were malleable and dynamic while suspended in intertextual structures."
2014,"p2451","Abstract","Our concept of documentscape points to how the hierarchical structure, sequentiality, and authorless nature of documents serve as a constitutive platform for the development of iterative and emergent work practices, making it possible for highly distributed actors to collaborate with limited communication, as the documentscape serves as a vehicle of coordination."

2016,"p3637-rello","Abstract","These findings provide evidence that text-heavy websites should use fonts of size 18 or larger and use default line spacing when the goal is to make a web page easy to read and comprehend."
2016,"p3637-rello","Abstract","Our results significantly differ from previous recommendations, presumably, because this is the first work to cover font sizes beyond 14 points."

2010,"p557-li","Abstract","These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted."
2010,"p557-li","Abstract","From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people’s lives to enrich the value of systems."
2012,"p1149","Abstract","Through a working speech recognition prototype, we discuss two major contributions of this work: first, we give empirical evidence that shows the extent to which productive training (i.e. vocalizing words) is superior to receptive vocabulary training, and discuss the use of scaffolding hints to “unpack” factors in the learner’s linguistic knowledge that may impact reading."
2018,"paper208","Abstract","In a Wizard of Oz study, we found that, for the task of cooking a recipe, nearly one-quarter of all user-assistant exchanges were initiated from implicit conversational cues rather than from plain questions."
2018,"paper208","Abstract","Given that these implicit cues occur in such high frequency, we conclude by presenting a set of design implications for the design of guided task experiences in contemporary conversational assistants."

2016,"p2623-doroudi","Abstract","However, such training relies on access to domain expertise, which may be expensive or lacking."
2016,"p2623-doroudi","Abstract","We show that having workers validate the work of their peer workers can be even more effective than having them review expert examples if we only present solutions filtered by a threshold length."
2016,"p2623-doroudi","Abstract","The results suggest that crowdsourced solutions of peer workers may be harnessed in an automated training pipeline."

2016,"p1200-cecchinato","Abstract","Moreover, retrieval occurs primarily on laptops and PCs compared to smartphones."
2016,"p4238-oakley","Abstract","We report generally positive user reactions to these demonstrators: the area touch interactions were perceived as quick, convenient and easy to learn and remember."
